**Network Address Translation (NAT)**: All devices in local network share just one IPv4 address as far as outside world is concerned
## 22.1 Motivation for NAT
- Just one IP address (maybe multiple) for all devices
- Can change addresses of devices in local network without notifying outside world 
- Can change ISP without changing addresses of devices in local network
- Devices inside local net not explicitly addressable, visible by outside world (a security plus)
## 22.2 Static vs. Dynamic NAT
**Static NAT**: Maps an unregistered IP address to a registered IP address on a one-to-one basis
- Example: The computer with the IP address of 192.168.0.2 will always translate to 215.234.17.17

**Dynamic NAT**: Maps an unregistered IP address to a registered IP address from a group of registered IP addresses
- Example: The computer with the IP address of 192.168.0.3 will translate to the first available address in the range from 215.234.17.18 to 215.234.17.22

**Overloading**: A form of dynamic NAT that maps multiple unregistered IP addresses to a single registered IP address by using different ports. Known also as PAT (Port Address Translation), single address NAT or port-level multiplexed NAT
- Example: Each computer on the private network is translated to the same IP address (e.g. 56.113.21.44) but with a different port number assignment.
## 22.3 NAT Traversal Problem
- Client wants to connect to server with address 10.0.0.1
	- Server address 10.0.0.1 local to LAN (client can't use it as destination address)
	- Only one external visible NATed address: 138.76.29.7
- Solution 1: Statically configure NAT to forward incoming connection requests at given port to server
	- e.g., (123.76.29.7, port 2500) always forwarded to 10.0.0.1 port 25000
- Solution 2: Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Internet Gateway Device (IGD) Protocol. Allows NATed host to:
	- Learn public address (138.76.29.7)
	- Add/remove port mappings (with lease times)
