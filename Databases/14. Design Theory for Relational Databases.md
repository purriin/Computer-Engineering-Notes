## Introduction
- Many different schemas can represent the same data.
- Choosing a schema involves determining what is "better" based on certain principles.
- **Goal:** Use design theory to guide schema selection.
## Database Design Theory
- Helps improve schema **systematically**.
- **Express constraints** (functional dependencies).
- Decompose relations using these constraints.
- Result: schemas in **normal form** → desirable properties.
# Part I: Functional Dependency (FD) Theory
## Redundancy in Poor Design
- Example table contains redundant manufacturer and seller addresses.
- Redundancy leads to:
  - **Update anomalies**
  - **Deletion anomalies**
## Functional Dependencies (FDs)
- **Definition:** X → Y means if two rows agree on X, they must agree on Y.
- **Mathematical Expression:**  
  If t1[X] = t2[X] then t1[Y] = t2[Y].
### Examples:
- `part → manufacturer`
- `manufacturer → manAddress`
- `seller → sellerAddress`
## Why "Functional" Dependency?
- Dependency: Y depends on X.
- Functional: A value for X determines a **unique** value for Y.
## Manipulating FDs
- Equivalent sets of FDs exist (e.g., A→BC is same as A→B and A→C).
- **Splitting rules:**
  - RHS and LHS of FDs can be decomposed for simplification.
## FDs vs Keys
- A **superkey** functionally determines all attributes.
- **FDs** generalize keys:
  - `X → R` (superkey)
  - `X → Y` (FD)
## Inferring FDs
- Can infer new FDs from given set.
- Two methods:
  1. **First principles**
  2. **Closure test** – compute X⁺ to see what is functionally determined.
## FD Closure Algorithm
```python
Attribute_closure(Y, S):
  Initialize Y+ to Y
  Repeat until no more changes:
    If LHS → RHS in S and LHS ⊆ Y+:
      Add RHS to Y+
```
## Checking if FD follows:
```python
FD_follows(S, X → Y):
  return (Y ⊆ Attribute_closure(X, S))
```
## Projecting FDs
- Required when decomposing schemas.
- Project(S, L) → All FDs involving only attributes from L.
## Minimal Basis
- Find smallest equivalent set of FDs.
- Steps:
  1. Split RHS.
  2. Minimize LHS.
  3. Remove redundant FDs.
# Part II: Applying FD Theory to Design
## Why Use FDs
- Identify redundancy in schema.
- Guide decomposition to reduce redundancy.
## Decomposition
- Given R(A1,…,An), decompose into:
  - R1(B1,…,Bj)
  - R2(C1,…,Ck)
- Must satisfy:
  - `B ∪ C = A`
  - `R = R1 ⋈ R2`
## Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
- R is in **BCNF** if:
  - For every non-trivial FD X → Y, X is a **superkey**.
- Benefits:
  - Eliminates redundancy and anomalies.
## BCNF Decomposition Algorithm
1. Find violating FD X → Y.
2. Compute X⁺.
3. Replace R with:
   - R1 = X⁺
   - R2 = R - (X⁺ - X)
4. Project FDs onto R1 and R2.
5. Recursively apply BCNF.
## Decomposition Properties
**We want:**
1. No anomalies ✅
2. **Lossless join** ✅
3. **Dependency preservation** ❌ (not guaranteed by BCNF)
## 3rd Normal Form (3NF)
- Less strict than BCNF.
- FD X → A violates 3NF if:
  - X is not a superkey AND A is not prime (i.e., not in any key).
- **3NF Synthesis Algorithm** ensures:
  - **Lossless join**
  - **Dependency preservation**
  - (Allows some anomalies)
## Synthesis vs Decomposition
- **Synthesis (3NF):** Build schema from minimal basis.
- **Decomposition (BCNF):** Break down bad schema.
## Lossless Join Testing
- BCNF and 3NF algorithms guarantee lossless joins.
- Arbitrary schemas that satisfy BCNF/3NF might still need to be checked.
## Chase Test
- Use to test for **lossless join**.
- Algorithm:
  1. Apply FDs to equate subscripts.
  2. If row becomes unsubscripted → join is lossless.
  3. Else → join is lossy.
