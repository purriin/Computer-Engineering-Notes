## 1. Overview
- Use the **Entity/Relationship (ER) model** to represent the real world.
- Steps:
  1. Model reality using ER.
  2. Restructure the ER model.
  3. Translate ER to a logical schema (DB schema).
## 2. Basic Concepts
### 2.1 Entities and Relationships
- **Entity:** object with properties (e.g., City, Employee)
- **Relationship:** association between entities (e.g., Residence between City and Employee)
- **Attributes:** describe entities and relationships (e.g., Age, Name)
### 2.2 Entity Set vs Relationship Set
- **Entity Set:** category of objects (e.g., Employee)
- **Relationship Set:** category of associations (e.g., Teaches)
## 3. Special Relationships
- **Recursive Relationships:** entity relates to itself (e.g., Mentor)
- **Ternary Relationships:** involve three entity sets
- **Attributes:**
  - Can be composite or multi-valued
  - Can have cardinalities like (1,1), (0,N)
## 4. Keys and Cardinalities
- **Key:** unique identifier (single or multi-attribute)
- **Weak Entity Set:** lacks its own key; relies on related entity's key
- **Relationship Key:** combo of keys from involved entities
- **Cardinality:** specifies how many times an entity participates in a relationship
## 5. Design Rules and Decisions
- Prefer internal keys and attributes when possible.
- Avoid redundancy by choosing between entity sets and attributes wisely.
- Weak entity sets are used when global unique IDs aren't feasible.
- Avoid overusing weak entity sets; internal IDs are preferred.
## 6. Real-World Modeling Example
- Training company:
  - Entities: Trainees, Instructors, Courses, Editions
  - Relationships: Attends, Teaches, EmployedBy
  - Handles info like social security number, assessments, seminars, expertise.
## 7. Restructuring the ER Model
### 7.1 Key Steps:
- Analyze redundancies.
- Choose between entity sets and attributes.
- Limit weak entity sets.
- Select keys carefully.
- Convert multi-valued attributes to entity sets.
## 8. Best Practices
- **Entity Set if:**
  - Has non-key attributes.
  - Is a “many” in a relationship.
- **Attribute if:**
  - Just detail about an entity.
- Avoid long string/multi-attribute keys: prefer internal integer keys.
## 9. Translating ER to DB Schema
### 9.1 Process
- Each **entity set** → a relation with its attributes.
- Each **relationship** → a relation with:
  - Keys from connected entities.
  - Attributes of the relationship.
## 10. Relationship Translation Examples
### 10.1 Many-to-Many Binary
```sql
Employee(Number, Surname, Salary)
Project(Code, Name, Budget)
Participation(Number, Code, StartDate)
```
### 10.2 Recursive
```sql
Composition(Part, SubPart, Quantity)
```
### 10.3 Ternary
```sql
Supply(Supplier, Product, Department, Quantity)
```
## 11. Simplifying Translations
- **One-to-Many** with mandatory participation:
  - Embed the foreign key directly in one of the relations.
- **One-to-One**:
  - Several options: merge into one entity, embed in either entity, or split.
## 12. Summary of Relationship Types
- **Many-to-Many** (binary or ternary)
- **One-to-Many**: mandatory or optional
- **One-to-One**: mandatory on both or one side
## 13. Schema Quality
- ER → DB schema ensures **no redundancy** from ER’s perspective.
- Doesn’t ensure full integrity due to lack of **functional dependency theory**.
- Need to combine with **FD theory** for complete design quality.
## 14. Redundancy: When It’s Good
- **Bad:**
  - Storage cost, inconsistency risk
- **Good:**
  - Improves access speed

**Decision:** Use performance analysis to balance tradeoffs.
