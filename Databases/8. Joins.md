## 8.1 Recap
###### Joins from Relational Algebra
| Expression | Meaning |
| ---- | ---- |
| $R, S$<br>$R \text{ cross join } S$ | $R \times S$ |
| $R \text{ natural join } S$ | $R \bowtie S$ |
| $R \text{ join S on Condition}$ | $R \bowtie_{condition} S$ |
- These can go in a `FROM` clause
- In practice natural join is brittle
	- The worst part: we get no syntax or run-time error!
		- The code just starts doing the wrong thing
	- We say that natural join is "brittle"
	- Also, having implicit comparisons impairs readability
	- Best practice: Don't use natural join
## 8.2 Outer Joins
**Dangling Tuples**
- With joins that require some attributes to match, tuples lacking a match are left out of the results
- We say that they are "dangling"

**Outer Join**: Preserves dangling tuples by padding them with `NULL` in the other relation

**Inner Join**: A join that doesn't pad with `NULL`

- 3 kinds of outer join:
	1. `LEFT OUTER JOIN`: Preserves dangling tuples from the relation on the LHS by padding with nulls on the RHS
	2. `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`: The reverse
	3. `FULL OUTER JOIN`: Does both

- There are keywords `INNER` and `OUTER` but you never need to use them
- Your intentions are clear anyway:
	- You get an outer join if and only if you use the keywords `LEFT`, `RIGHT` or `FULL`
	- If you do not use these keywords you get an inner join

## 8.3 Summary of Join Expressions
**Cartesian Product**
`A CROSS JOIN B` same as `A,B`

**Theta-Join**
`A JOIN B ON C`  
✓`A { LEFT|RIGHT|FULL} JOIN B ON C`

**Natural Join**
`A NATURAL JOIN B` 
✓`A NATURAL { LEFT|RIGHT|FULL} JOIN B`

✓ indicates that tuples are padded when needed
