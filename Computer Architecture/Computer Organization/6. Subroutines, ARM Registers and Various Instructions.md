### 1. ARM Registers
- `R0`-`R12`: General Purpose Registers
- `R13`: SP Stack Pointer
	- Used to push or pop data onto/off a stack
- `R14`: LR Link Register
	- Used to return from a subroutine
- `R15`: Program Counter (PC)
### 2. Subroutine Example
- In C Code:
```c
main() {
	int x, y;
	y = 10;
	x = my_sub(y);
}

int my_sub(int i) {
	return i + 1;
}
```
- In Assembly:
```arm-asm
MAIN: mov R4, #10
	  mov R0, R4
	  // Subparameters must be put in R0
	  BL my_sub
NEXT: ...
	  ...
// Input must be in R0
// Output result returned in R0
my_sub: ADD R0, R0
		mov PC, LR
```
- `BL`: Branch with Link
	- Performs 2 actions:
		1. Sets LR (aka `R14`) to the subroutine return address (in this code LR <- NEXT)
		2. Sets PC to the address of the subroutine (in this case PC <- my_sub)
### 3. Additional Detail About Memory
- LDR: This instruction loads a word of data from memory. But we alternatively load just a byte with LDRB
	- LDRSB (signed byte SB)
- Note: you can also load half-words (16 bit). The instructions are LDRH and LDRSH
	- We also have similar variants for STR, STRB, STRH
- Important: We can use any address when loading or storing a byte
	- But when loading/storing a word we must use a word-aligned address that is a multiple of 4
- Note: All word aligned addresses end in the 2 bits 00
- Note: if you perform LDR/STR with an address that is not word aligned the processor will execute an error process
