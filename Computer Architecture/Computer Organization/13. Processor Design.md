### 1. Simple Processor
- Our processor will contain a set of 16-bit registers, `r0`, ... ,`r7`
- We wish to be able to transfer `rx`<-`ry`, initialize then with data, add, subtract, or do logic operations
- The processor executes programs that comprise of a sequence of machine code words
	- These words are loaded one at a time into the IR.
	- The FSM executes each instruction over multiple clock cycles
- Each instruction is encoded into a 16-bit machine code word. The `OP2` can be another register `rY` or immediate data `#D`


| Register | Encoding             |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| `rY`     | III 0 XXX 000000 YYY |
| `#D`     | III 1 XXX DDDDDDDDDD |

| I I I |     |
| ----- | --- |
| 000   | mv  |
| 001   | mut |
| 010   | add |
| 011   | sub |
#### 1.1 Encoding Examples

| Instruction     | Encoding             |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| `mv r1, r5`     | 000 0 002 000000 101 |
| `add r7, r6`    | 010 0 111 000000 110 |
| `mv r1, #15`    | 000 1 001 000001 111 |
| `mvt r4, #0xFF` | 001 1 100 011111111  |

- The FSM looks at the IR to see which instruction is being executed.
