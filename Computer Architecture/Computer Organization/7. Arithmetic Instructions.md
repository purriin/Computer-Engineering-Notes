- There are multiple and accumulate instructions:
	- `MUL R1, R2, R3`: $R1=R2*R3$
	- `MLA R1, R2, R3, R4`: $R1 = R2*R3+R4$
### 1. Logic Instructions
- ARM supports bitwise AND, ORR
- ARM provides exclusive or (EOR)
	- "mnemonic" means "name"
### 2. Shift/Rotate Instructions
- LSR (Logical shift right)
	- To perform multiplication by $2^k$, logical shift left by $k$ positions
- ASR (Arithmetic shift right)
	- To perform signed division by $2^k$ we can use ASR by $k$ positions
		- You can also specify the shift amount in a register
- ASR and LSR are the same except for what is shifted to the MSB
	- For LSB, 0 gets shifted in
	- For ASR sign bit is replicated
### 3. Nested Subroutines
- If a subroutine needs to call a nested subroutine, it must save a copy of its LR before executing BL
### 4. Using the Stack for ARM
- Register `R13` is dedicated for use as a stack pointer, `SP`
- ARM has 2 dedicated stack instructions
	1. `PUSH {R0, R1, ... , RZ}`
	2. `POP {R0, R1, ... , RZ}`
- We must initialize SP to the some address that will not interfere with out program or data
	- Ex. `0x2000`
