## 13.1 Schema: A Kind of Namespace
- Everything defined (tables, types, etc.) goes into one big pot.
- Schemas let you create different namespaces.
- Useful for logical organization, and for avoiding name clashes.

## 13.2 Creating a Schema
- You already have a schema called "public"
- You can also create your own. Example:
```sql
create schema University;
```
- To refer to things inside a particular schema, you can use dot notation:
```sql
create table University.Student (...);
select * from University.Student;
```

**If you don't use Dot Notation**
- If you refer to a name without specifying what schema it is within:
	- Any new names you define go in the schema called "public"
	- E.g., if you create a table called `frindle`, you actually are defining `public.frindle`
	- When referring to a name, there is a search path that finds it

## 13.3 The Search Path
- To see it the search path: `show search_path;`
- You can set the search path yourself. Example: `set search_path to University, public:`
- The default search path is: "$user", public
	- Schema "$user" is not created for you, but if you create it, it's at the front of the search path
	- Schema `public` is created for you

## 13.4 Removing a Schema
- Easy: `drop schema University cascade;`
- "`cascade`" means everything inside it is dropped too
- To avoid getting an error message if the schema does not exist, ass "`if exists`"

## 13.5 Usage Pattern
- You can use this at the top of every DDL file:
```sql
drop schema if exists University cascade;
create schema University;
set search_path to University;
```
- Helpful during development, when you may want to change the schema, or test queries under different conditions

## 13.6 Workflow
- One effective way to work:
	- Create DDL file with the schema
	- Create a file with inserts to put content in the database
	- In the postgreSQL shell, import these
	- Run queries directly in the shell or by importing queries written in files
