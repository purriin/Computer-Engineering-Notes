- You can manage a large collection of data with files
- In fact, the first commercial databases evolved this way
- Some problems: structure, security, persistence
- Instead, it would be better to have an efficient, optimized system that specializes in handling large amounts of data

## 1.1 Databases and DBMSs
- Databases are everywhere, often behind the scenes

**Database Management System (DBMS)**: A powerful tool for *creating* and *managing* (updating, querying) *large* (petabytes or more) amounts of data *efficiently* and allowing it to *persist* over long periods of time, *safely*

**Database**: A collection of data managed by a DBMS

- Every DBMS is based on some *data model*

**Data Model**: A notation for describing data, including:
- The structure of the data
- Constraints on the content of the data
- Operations on the data

- The relational data model: main concept is a "relation"

## 1.2 Example: Relational Model

**Relations**: The subject (ex. Teams, Games)
**Attributes**: Columns (ex. Name, Home Field, Coach)
**Tuples**: Rows (with values called attributes)

1. Teams:

| Name | Home Field | Coach |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Rangers | Runnymede Cl | Tarvo Sinervo |
| Ducks | Humber Public | Tracy Zheng |
| Choppers | High Park | Ammar Jalali |

2. Games:

| Home Team | Away Team | Home Goals | Away Goals |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Rangers | Ducks | 3 | 0 |
| Ducks | Choppers | 1 | 1 |
| Rangers | Choppers | 4 | 2 |
| Choppers | Ducks | 0 | 5 |

**Examples**:
- A dataset scraped from Twitter
- Defining a schema that expresses its structure
- Creating an instance that contains the data
- Writing some queries on the data

- Don't need to think of how something will be done, we are concerned with what we want done (the outcome)

## 1.3 **What a DBMS Provides**
- Ability to specify the logical structure of the data (explicitly and have it enforced)
	- Ex. No 2 students have the same ID 
- Ability to query or modify the data
- Good performance under heavy loads (huge data, many queries)
- Durability of the data
- Concurrent access by multiple users/processes

**Architecture of a Relational DBMS**
- The DBMS sits between the data and the users or between the data and an application program
- Within the DBMS are layers of software for:
	- Parsing "queries"
	- Implementing the fundamental operations
	- Optimizing queries
	- Maintaining indices on the data
	- Accessing the files that store the data and indices
	- Management of buffers
	- Management of disk space

**Relational is Strict**
- The relational model is very strict
- Can't record any data until we formally defined aa schema
- The schema must be strictly adhered to
- All rows should have data for all columns

## 1.4 Other Data Models
**Semi-Structured Data Model**:
- More flexible
- Example Tools: JSON, XML

**Unstructured Data**:
- Data that doesn't conform to any fixed structure, e.g., document, video, etc.
- Can be stored in a key-value store
- Example Tools: Couchbase, Amazon DynamoDB

**Graph Data Model**:
- A node could represent a student or a course
- An edge could represent taking a course
- A query is defined by a path
- Example Tool: neo4j
