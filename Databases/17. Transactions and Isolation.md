## Atomicity
- Real-world DBMS systems serve millions of concurrent processes.
- Each DB operation is assumed atomic (all internal steps succeed).
- **But failures can occur** (network, crash, etc.).
## What Can Go Wrong?
- The DB may enter an inconsistent state not explainable by operations performed.
- Even with one client, failure between operations can lead to problems.
## Example A: Transfer Funds

```sql
update Accounts set balance = balance + 1000 where acctNum = 111;
update Accounts set balance = balance - 1000 where acctNum = 222;
```

**Problems:**
- Failure between the two updates.
- Insufficient funds in account 222.

**Solution:** use **transactions**.
## Transactions in SQL

- A transaction is a group of operations that must be executed atomically.
### Syntax:

```sql
BEGIN;      -- Start transaction
COMMIT;     -- End successfully, make changes permanent
ROLLBACK;   -- End with failure, undo all changes
```

- Default behavior: each statement is treated as a transaction if not specified.
## Concurrency Issues
### Many simultaneous processes can interfere.
## Example B: Seat Booking Conflict

Steps:
1. Customer 111 sees seat 11B available.
2. Customer 222 sees 11B available.
3. Both attempt to book it.

**Result:** Both believe they've booked the same seat.  
**Problem:** **Serialization anomaly**
## Example C: Phantom Read

Steps:
1. Customer 111 sees 11A & 11B as available.
2. Customer 111 books 11A. Commits.
3. Customer 111 unbooks 11A. Commits.
4. Customer 222 sees 11B available.
5. Customer 111 sees both seats available again.

**Problem:** The query result changes due to committed changes.  
**Term:** **Phantom read**
## Example D: Non-repeatable Read

Steps:
1. Customer 111 reads seat 11B as available.
2. Customer 222 books 11B. Commits.
3. Customer 111 tries to book 11B and fails.

**Problem:** A row changes after it was read.  
**Term:** **Non-repeatable read**
## Solution: Isolation Levels

SQL defines **4 isolation levels**.  
**PostgreSQL default:** `read committed`.
### Isolation Levels

#### 1. Read Committed (default)
- Prevents **dirty reads** (reading uncommitted changes).
- Still allows phantom and non-repeatable reads.
#### 2. Repeatable Read
- Prevents **non-repeatable reads**.
- PostgreSQL also prevents **phantom reads** at this level.
#### 3. Serializable
- Prevents **serialization anomalies**.
- Ensures a result equivalent to running transactions one-at-a-time.
## Choosing an Isolation Level
- `Serializable` gives the **strongest guarantee**.
- **Tradeoff:** More isolation can reduce concurrency.
- **Recommended:**
  - Use `read committed` by default.
  - Use `serializable` when overlapping transactions read/write the same rows.
## Using Transactions in psycopg2
### Sample code:
```python
try:
    conn = pg.connect(<details>)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    # SQL statements go here

except (pg.errors.ForeignKeyViolation, pg.errors.UniqueViolation, ...):
    print('An error occurred; nothing was updated')
    conn.rollback()

else:
    conn.commit()

finally:
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
```
- Wrap SQL in a `try-except` block.
- `commit()` on success, `rollback()` on failure.
