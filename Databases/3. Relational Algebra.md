**Elementary Algebra**
- You did algebra in high school: $27y^2+8y-3$
- Operands:
- Operators:

**Relational Algebra**
- Operands: tables
- Operators:
	- Choose only the rows you want
	- Choose only the columns you want
	- Combine tables
	- and a few other things

## 3.1 Select
**Select**: Choose rows
- Notation: $\sigma_c(R)$
	- $R$ is a table
	- Condition $c$ is a boolean expression
	- It can use comparison operators and boolean operators
	- The operands are either constants or attributes of $R$
- The result is a relation
	- With the same schema as the operand
	- But with only the tuples that satisfy the condition

## 3.2 Project
- Notation: $\Pi_L(R)$
	- $R$ is a table
	- $L$ is a subset (not necessarily a proper subset) of the attributes of $R$
- The result is a relation
	- With all the tuples from $R$ 
	- But with only the attributes in $L$, and in that order

## 3.3 Cartesian Product
- Notation: $R_1 \times R_2$
- The result is a relation with every combination of a tuple from $R_1$ concatenated to a tuple from $R_2$
- Its schema is every attribute from $R$ followed by every attribute of $S$ in order
- If an attribute occurs in both relations it occurs twice in the result (prefixed by relation name)

## 3.4 Simplifications
- While learning relational algebra we assume:
	- Relations are sets so no 2 rows are the same (no duplicates)
	- Every cell has a value (no nulls)
- In SQL we will drop these assumptions
- But for not they simplify our queries
- And we will still build a great foundation for SQL

## 3.5 Projection and Duplicates 
- Projection onto fewer attributes can remove what it was that made 2 tuples distinct
- Wherever a project operation might "introduce" duplicates, only 1 copy of each is kept
- $\Pi \rightarrow$ usually to reduce the number of attributes, can also sometimes change the number of tuples
- Example:
##### People
| name | age |
| ---: | ---: |
| Karim | 20 |
| Ruth | 18 |
| Minh | 20 |
| Sofia | 19 |
| Jennifer | 19 |
| Sasha | 20 |
##### $\Pi_{age}$ People
| age |
| ---- |
| 20 |
| 18 |
| 19 |
- Q: $\sigma$ usually used to reduce number of tuples, can $\sigma$ reduce the number of attributes? Ans: No.

### 3.5.1 Example of Cartesian Product
##### Profiles:
| ID | name |
| ---- | ---- |
| oprah | Oprah Winfrey |
| ginab | Gina Bianchini |
##### Follows:
| follower | followee |
| ---- | ---- |
| oprah | ev123 |
| edyson | ginab |
| ginab | ev123 |
##### Profiles $\times$ Follows:
| ID | name | follower | followee |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| oprah | Oprah Winfrey | oprah | ev123 |
| oprah | Oprah Winfrey | edyson | ginab |
| oprah | Oprah Winfrey | ginab | ev123 |
| ginab | Gina Bianchini | oprah | ev123 |
| ginab | Gina Bianchini | edyson | ginab |
| ginnab | Gina Bianchini | ginab | ev123 |
- Profiles 2 tuples, Follows 3 tuples, Profiles $\times$ Follows 2 $\times$ 3 or 6 tuples
## 3.6 Composing Larger Expressions
- Math:
	- The value of any expression is a number
	- So you can "compose" larger expressions out of smaller ones
	- There are precedence rules
	- We can use brackets to override the normal precedence of operators
- Relational algebra is the same

- Cartesian product can be inconvenient
	- It can introduce nonsense tuples
	- You can get rid of them with selects
	- But this is so highly common an operation was defined to make it easier: *natural join*

## 3.7 Natural Join
- Notation: $R ⋈ S$ 
- The result is defined by:
	1. Taking the Cartesian product
	2. Selecting to ensuring equality on attributes (some values on shared attributes) that are in both relations (as determined by name of attribute)
	3. Projecting to remove duplicate attributes
- Example: Artists ⋈ Roles gets rid of nonsense tuples

**Properties of Natural Join**:
- Commutative:
	- R ⋈ S = S ⋈ R
	- Although attribute order may vary (be explicit about attribute order using $\Pi$) this will matter later when we use set operations
- Associative:
	- R ⋈ (S ⋈ T) = (R ⋈ S) ⋈ T
- So when writing n-ary joins, brackets are irrelevant. We can just write:
	- $R_1 ⋈ R_2 ⋈ ... ⋈ R_n$
### 3.7.1 Examples
- The following examples consider what natural join does when the tables have:
	- No attributes in common
	- One attribute in common
	- A different attribute in common
- (Note that we change the attribute names for relation *follows* to set up these scenarios)
- In 3.5.1 no attributes in common same thing would result

1. Attribute ID in common
##### Profiles:
| ID | name |
| ---- | ---- |
| oprah | Oprah Winfrey |
| ginab | Gina Bianchini |
##### Follows:
| ID | followee |
| ---- | ---- |
| oprah | ev123 |
| edyson | ginab |
| ginab | ev123 |
##### Profiles ⋈ Follows:
| ID | name | followee |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| oprah | Oprah Winfrey | ev123 |
| ginnab | Gina Bianchini | ev123 |

2. How many tuples are in Artists $\times$ Roles? Ans: $24 = 4\times 6$ 
##### Artists:
| aID | aName | nationality |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Nicholson | American |
| 2 | Ford | American |
| 3 | Stone | British |
| 4 | Fisher | American |
##### Roles:
| mID | aID | character |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 1 | Jack Torrance |
| 3 | 1 | Jake 'J.J.' Gittes |
| 1 | 3 | Delbert Grady |
| 5 | 2 | Han Solo |
| 6 | 2 | Bob Falfa |
| 5 | 4 | Princess Leia Organa |

3. How many tuples are in Artists ⋈ Roles? Ans: 6
	- Let's say we have 6 tuples in Roles
	- Could Artists ⋈ Roles have $\gt$ 6 tuples? Ans: No
		- Then some aID in Roles would appear more than once in Artist, not possible because aID is a key in Artists
	- Could Artists \sigma_{dept = csc \land cNum = 343} Roles have $\lt$ 6 tuples? Ans: No
		- Then Roles has an aID that is not in Artists, not possible because foreign key

4. $\Pi_{aName}\sigma_{director = 'Kubrick}$ (Artists ⋈ Roles ⋈ Movies) Ans: {\<Nicholson>, \<Stone>}
##### Movies:
| mID | title | director | year | length |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Shining | Kubrick | 1980 | 146 |
| 2 | Player | Altman | 1992 | 146 |
| 3 | Chinatown | Polanski | 1974 | 131 |
| 4 | Repulsion | Polanski | 1965 | 143 |
| 5 | Star Wars IV | Lucas | 1977 | 126 |
| 6 | American Graffiti | Lucas | 1973 | 110 |
| 7 | Full Metal Jacket | Kubrick | 1987 | 156 |
5. $\Pi_{aName}((\sigma_{director = 'Kubrick}$ Artists) ⋈ Roles ⋈ Movies) Ans: Invalid query

Answer the following questions with the given schema:
Student(sID, surName, firstName, campus, email, cgpa) 
Course(dept, cNum, name, breadth) 
Offering(oID, dept, cNum, term, instructor) 
Took(sID, oID, grade) 

Offering\[dept, cNum] $\subseteq$ Course\[dept, cNum] 
Took\[sID] $\subseteq$ Student\[sID] 
Took\[oID] $\subseteq$ Offering\[oID]

6. Write a query for:
	1. Student number of all students who have taken csc343.
		- $\Pi_{SID} (\sigma_{dept = csc \land cNum = 343} (Took ⋈ Offering))$
	2. Student number of all students who have taken csc343 and earned an A+ in it.
		- $DBFans(sID) := \Pi_{sID} (\sigma_{dept = csc \land cNum = 343 \land grade \ge 90} (Took ⋈ Offering))$
		- `NameOfNewRelation(names of any attributes) := <RA query>`
	3. The names of all such students
		- $\Pi_{firstName, surName} (DBFans ⋈ Student)$
	4. sIDs of all students who have earned some grade over 80 and some grade below 50
		- One approach is $\Pi_{SID}$ before $\bowtie$ 
		- $(\Pi_{sID}(\sigma_{grade \gt 80} Took)) \cap (\Pi_{sID}(\sigma_{grade \lt 50} Took))$
		- Set intersection
		- We can use set operations when we have the same attributes in the same order
	5. Terms when either Cook or Pitassi was teaching CSC463
		- Q: Can you look at a single tuple in this relation and decide if it should go in the result? Ans: Yes
		- $\Pi_{term} (\sigma_{dept = 'csc' \land cNum = 463 \land (instr = 'Cook' \lor instr = 'Pitassi')} Offering)$
	6. sID of students who have earned a grade of 85 or more, or who have passed a course taught by Atwood
		- Over85(sID) := $\Pi_{sID} (\sigma_{grade \gt 85} Took)$
		- PassedAtwood(sID) := $\Pi_{sID} (\sigma_{grade \ge 50 \land instr = 'Atwood'} (Took \bowtie Offering))$
		- Over85 $\bigcup$ PassedAtwood
		- Set union
	7. Terms when CSC369 was not offered
		- Given any tuple in offering, we can say NO if dept is csc and cNum = 369 but otherwise we can't say either way if it should be in result
		- DontWant(term) := $\Pi_{term} (\sigma_{dept = 'csc' \land cNum = 369} Offering)$
		- AllTerms(term) := $\Pi_{term} Offering$
		- AllTerms - DontWant
		- Set difference
	- Set Operations attributes and order must match
## 3.8 Special Cases for Natural Join
1. No tuples match
	- Empty
2. Exactly same attributes
	- Keep only the tuples that are exactly the same
3. No attributes in common
	- Same as Cartesian product

- Natural join can "over-match"
	- Natural join bases the matching on attribute names
	- What is 2 attributes have the same name but we don't want them to have to match
	- Example: If Artists used “name” for actors’ names and Movies used “name” for movies’ names
- Natural join can "under-match"
	- What if 2 attributes don't have the same name and we do want them to match?
	- Example: Suppose we want aName and director to match.

## 3.9 Theta Join
- It's common to use $\sigma$ to check conditions after a Cartesian product
- Theta Join makes this easier
- Advantage: explicit about what you want to join 2 relations on
- Notation: $R ⋈_{condition} S$
	- $R$ theta join $S$ on condition
- The result is the same as Cartesian product (not natural join) followed by select.
	- In other words $R ⋈_{condition} S = \sigma_{condition} (R\times S)$
- The word theta has no special connotation. It is an artifact of a definition in an early paper
- You save just one symbol
- You still have to write out the conditions since they are not inferred
