## 11.1 Types
- Table columns have types
	- When creating a table you must define the type of each column
	- Analogous to declaring a variable's type in a program. 
		- Ex. `int num;` in Java or C
	- Some programming languages don't require type declarations. 
		- Ex. Python

### 11.1.1 Built-In Types
1. `CHAR(n)`: Fixed-length string of n characters. Padded with blanks if necessary
2. `VARCHAR(n)`: Variable-length string of up to n characters
3. `TEXT`: Variable-length, unlimited. Not in the SQL standard but psql and others support it.
4. `INT`: Integer
5. `FLOAT`: Real
6. `BOOLEAN`
7. `DATE`, `TIME`, `TIMESTAMP` (date plus time)

- Values for these types:
	- Strings: `'Shakespeare''s Sonnets'`
		- Must surround with single quotes
	- `INT`: `37`
	- `FLOAT`: `1.49`, `37.96e2`
	- `BOOLEAN`: `TRUE`, `FALSE`
	- `DATE`: `'2011-09-22'`
	- `TIME`: `15:00:02`, `15:00:02.5`
	- `TIMESTAMP`: `'Jan-12-2011 10:25'`

- These are all defined in the SQL standard
- There is much more, e.g.,
	- Specifying the precision of numeric types
	- Other formats for data values
	- More types

### 11.1.2 User-Defined Types
- Defined in terms of a built-in type 
- You make it more specific by defining constraints (and perhaps a default value)
- Example:
```sql
create domain Grade as int
	default null
	check (value>=0 and value <=100);
create domain Campus as varchar(4)
	default ‘StG’
	check (value in (‘StG','UTM','UTSC'));
```

### 11.1.3 Semantics
**Type Constraints**
- Constraints on a type are checked every time a value is assigned to a column of that type
- You can use these to create a powerful type system

**Default Values**
- The default value for a type is used when no value has been specifies
- Useful - can run a query and insert the resulting rows into a table even if the query does not give values for all columns

**Default Values for a Type vs for a Column**
- The difference:
	- Column Default: For that one column in that one table
	- Type Default: For every column of that type in any table

## 11.2 Keys and Foreign Keys
### 11.2.1 Key Constraints
- Declaring that a set of one or more columns are the `PRIMARY KEY` for a table means:
	- Their values will be unique across rows
	- Their values never be null (you don't need to separately declare that)
- Big hint to the DBMS: optimize for searches by this set of columns!
- Every table must have 0 or 1 primary key
	- A table can have no primary key but in practice every table should have one
	- You cannot declare more than one primary key

**Declaring Primary Keys**
- Can be at the end of the table definition. Brackets are required:
```sql
create table Person (
	ID integer, 
	name varchar(25), 
	primary key (ID));
```
- For a single-column key, can declare it with the column:
```sql
create table Person (
	ID integer primary key,
	name varchar(25));
```

**Declaring Multi-Column Primary Keys**
- Can be at the end of the table definition:
```sql
create table Undergrad (
	firstname varchar(25),
	lastname varchar(25),
	campus varchar(3),
	birthdate date,
	primary key (lastname, campus));
```
- For a multi-column key, can't declare it with a column

### 11.2.2 Uniqueness Constraints
- Declaring that a set of one or more attributes is `UNIQUE` for a table means:
	- Their values will be unique across rows
	- But their values *can* be null; if they mustn't, you need to separately declare that
- You can declare more than 1 set of attributes to be `UNIQUE`

**Declaring UNIQUE**
- Can be at the end of the table definition. Brackets are required:
```sql
create table Ontarian (
	SIN integer primary key,
	name varchar(25),
	OHIP integer
	unique (OHIP));
```
- If only one column is involved, can declare with the column

**How NULLs affect UNIQUE**
- Ex. Consider:
```sql 
create table Testunique (
	first varchar(25),
	last varchar(25),
	unique(first, last))
```
- This would prevent 2 insertions of: `('Diane', 'Horton')`
- But what about 2 insertions of this: `(null, 'Schoeler’)`
	- For uniqueness no 2 nulls are considered equal. So these inserts are allowed
- This isn't an issue with a primary key

### 11.2.3 Foreign Key Constraints
- Ex. in table Took: `foreign key (sID) references Student`
- Means that column `sID` in this table is a foreign key that references the primary key of table Student
	- Every value for `sID` in this table must actually occur in the Student table
- Requirements:
	- Must be declared either primary key or unique in the "home" table

**Declaring Foreign Keys**
- Again, declare as a separate table element, or with the column (only possible is just a single column is involved)
- Can reference column(s) that are not the primary key as long as they are unique; just name them
```sql
create table People (
	SIN integer primary key,
	name text,
	OHIP text unique);
create table Volunteers (
	email text primary key,
	OHIPnum text references People(OHIP));
```

**Enforcing Foreign-Key Constraints**
- Suppose there is a foreign-key constraint from table R to table S
- When must the DBMS ensure that:
	- The referenced columns are `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE`?
	- The values actually exist?
- A violation could occur
- You get to define what the DBMS should do
- This is called specifying a "reaction policy"

## 11.3 Other Kinds of Constraints
## 11.3.1 "Check" Constraints
- We've seen a check clause on a user-defined domain:
```sql
create domain Grade as smallint
	default null
	check (value>=0 and value <=100);
```
- You can also define a constraint:
	1. One a column (as part of the column's definition)
	2. On the rows of a table (at the end of the table definition)
	3. Across tables (with assertions or triggers)

**1. Column-Based "Check" Constraints**
- Defined with a single column and constrain its value (in every row)
- Ex:
```sql
create table Application (
	sID integer,
	previous integer check (previous >= 0)
);
```
- Constrain that column's value in every row
- Condition can be anything that could go in a `WHERE` clause

- SQL standard says they can include a subquery. Ex:
```sql
create table Student (
	sID integer,
	program varchar(5) check
	(program in (select post from P)),
	firstName varchar(35) not null,
	lastName varchar(35) not null
);
```
- But use of a subquery is not supported by psql

When they are Checked:
- Only when a row is inserted into that table or its value for that column is updated
- If a change somewhere else violates the constraint, the DBMS will not notice. Ex.
	- If a student's program changes to something not in table P we get an error
	- But if table P drops a program that some student has, there is no error
- This is only an issue if the constraint involves a subquery

"Not NULL" Constraints:
- You can declare that a column of a table is NOT NULL
```sql
create table Course(
	cNum integer,
	name varchar(40) not null,
	dept Department,
	wr boolean,
	primary key (cNum, dept));
```
- In practice, many columns should be `not null`
- This is a very specific kind of column-based constraint

**2. Row-Based "Check" Constraints**
- Defined as a separate element of the table schema, so can refer to *any* column of the table
- Again, condition can be anything that could go in a `WHERE` clause and can include a subquery
- Example:
```sql
create table Student (
	sID integer,
	age integer, year integer,
	college varchar(4),
	check (year = age - 18)
);
```

When they are checked:
- Only when a row is inserted into that table or updated
- Again, if a change somewhere else violates the constraint, the DBMS will not notice

How nulls affect "check" constraints
- A check constraint only fails if it evaluated to false
- It is not picky like a `WHERE` condition

Example:
- Suppose you created this table:
```sql
create table Frequencies(
	word varchar(10),
	num integer,
	check (num > 5));
```
- It would allow you to insert `('hello', null)` since `null` passes the constraint `check (num > 5)`
- If you need to prevent that, use a "not null" constraint
```sql
create table Frequencies(
	word varchar(10),
	num integer not null,
	check (num > 5));
```

Naming your Constraints:
- If you name your constraint, you will get more helpful error messages
- This can be done with any of the types of constraint we've seen
- Add `constraint <name>` before the `check (<condition>)`

Examples:
```sql
create domain Grade as smallint
	default null
	constraint gradeInRange
	check (value>=0 and value <=100));
create domain Campus as varchar(4)
	 not null
	 constraint validCampus
	 check (value in ('StG', 'UTM', 'UTSC'));
create table Offering(...
	constraint validCourseReference
	 foreign key (cNum, dept) references Course);
```

**3. Cross-Table Constraints: Assertions**
- Check constraints can't express complex constraints across tables, e.g.,
	- Every loan has at least 1 customer, who has an account with at least $1000
	- For each branch the sum of all loan amounts is less than the sum of all account balances
- Assertions are schema elements at the top level so can express cross-table constraints:
```sql
create assertion (<name>) check (<predicate>);
```

- Powerful but costly
- SQL has a fairly powerful syntax for expressing the predicates, including quantification
- Assertions are costly because
	- They have to be checked upon every database update (although a DBMS may be able to limit this)
	- Each check can be expensive
- Testing and maintenance are also difficult
- Assertions are not supported by PostgreSQL (or by most/all other DBMSs)

**Triggers**
- Assertions are powerful but costly
- Check constraints are less costly, but less powerful
- Triggers are a compromise between these extremes:
	- They are powerful
	- But you control the cost by having control over when they are applied

- The basic idea:
	- You specify a type of database event that you want to respond to, e.g., `after delete on Courses` or `before update of grade on Took`
	- You specify the response, e.g., `insert into Winners values (sID)`
	- The response is wrapped up in a function

**The Response Function**
```sql
create function RecordWinner() returns trigger
as
$$
BEGIN
	IF NEW.grade >= 85 THEN
	INSERT INTO Winners VALUES (NEW.sid);
	END IF;
	RETURN NEW;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

The trigger that uses it:
```sql
create trigger TookUpdate
before insert on Took
for each row
execute procedure RecordWinner();
```

## 11.4 Reaction Policies
Example:
- Consider Took Student
- What sorts of updates could violate their foreign-key relationship?
- Could we perhaps recover from some or all of them?

**Possible Policies**
- `cascade`: Propagate the change to the referring table
- `set null`: Set the referring column(s) to null
- There are other options we won't cover. Many DBMSs don't support all of them
- If you say nothing, the default is to forbid the change in the referred-to table

**Note the Asymmetry**:
- Suppose table R refers to table S
- You can define "fixes" that propagate changes backwards from S to R
- (You define them in table R because it is the table that will be affected)
- You cannot define fixes that propagate forward from R to S

**Syntax for Specifying a Reaction Policy**
- Add your reaction policy where you specify the foreign key constraint
- Example:
```sql
create table Took (
	...
	foreign key (sID) references Student
	on delete cascade
	...
);
```

**What you can React to**:
- Your reaction policy can specify what to do either
	- `on delete`, i.e., when a deletion creates a dangling reference
	- `on update`, i.e., when an update creates a dangling reference
	- or both, just put them one after the other
	- Example: `on delete restrict on update cascade`

**What your Reaction can be**:
- Your policy can specify one of these reactions (there are others):
	- `restrict`: Don't allow the deletion/update
	- `cascade`: Make the same deletion/update in the referring row
	- `set null`: Set the corresponding value in the referring row to null

**Semantics of Deletion**
- Suppose we are deleting a bunch of rows and:
	- Deleting one row violates a foreign key constraint
	- But deleting others does not
- The DBMS could:
	- Halt at the error but keep any earlier deletes
	- Roll back the earlier deletes and make none at all
	- Make all the deletes except the violating ones
- This likely varies across DBMSs
	- If you assume a particular behaviour, you may lose portability

- What if deleting one row affects the outcome for a row encountered later?
- To prevent such interactions, deletion proceeds in 2 stages:
	- Mark all rows for which the `WHERE` condition is satisfies
	- Go back and delete the marked rows

## 11.5 DDL Wrap-Up
**Updating the Schema itself**
- Alter: Alter a domain or table
```sql
alter table Course
	add column numSections integer;
alter table Course
	drop column breadth;
```
- Drop: Remove a domain, table or whole schema
```sql
drop table course;
```
- If you drop a table that is referenced by another table, you must specify "cascade." This removes all referring rows

- Can also define:
	- Indices: For making search faster (we'll discuss these later)
	- Privileges: Who can do what with what parts of the database

**A Little SQL History**
- First proposal: SEQUEL (1974, IBM Research)
- First implementation: 1981, IBM
- Standardization was crucial for its diffusion
- Note: 2 uses of the word "standard"
	- A technical specification (as in ANSI, ISO, etc)
	- "What everybody uses"
- Most relational DBMSs support basic SQL and add on proprietary extensions
- Arguably, the SQL standard, although well defined is not a true standard anymore
- This is because of failure by DBMS vendors to do (and major purchasers to require) compliance testing
