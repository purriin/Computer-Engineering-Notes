- Based on [Bellman-Ford (BF)](Bellman-Ford) equation (dynamic programming):
$$
\text{Bellman-Ford Equation}
\begin{gathered}
&\text{Let } D_x(y) :\text{cost of least-cost path from x to y.} \\
& \text{Then: }D_x(y) = min_v(c_{x,v} + D_v(y))
\end{gathered}
$$
- min taken over all neighbours v of x
- $c_{x,v}$ : direct cost of link from x to v
- v's estimated least-cost-path cost to y
## 25.1 Distance Vector Algorithm
- Key Idea:
	- From time-to-time, each node sends its own distance vector to estimate neighbours
	- When x receives new DV estimate from any neighbour, it updates its own DV using BF equation: $D_x(y) \leftarrow min_v \{c_{x,v} + D_v(y)\}$ for each node $y \in N$
	- Under minor, natural conditions, the estimate $D_x(y)$ converges to the actual least cost $d_x(y)$

- Iterative, asynchronous: each local iteration caused by:
	- Local link cost change
	- DV update message from neighbour
- Distributed, self-stopping: each node notifies neighbours only when its DV changes
	- Neighbours then notify their neighbours only if necessary
	- No notification received no actions taken
## 25.2 Comparison of LS and DV Algorithms
- See [Asymptotics](Asymptotics)
- Message complexity:
	- LS: n routers O($n^2$) messages send
	- DV: exchange between neighbours; convergence time varies
- Speed of convergence:
	- LS: O($n^2$) algorithm O($n^2$) messages
		- May have oscillations
	- DV: convergence time varies
		- May have routing loops
		- Count-to-infinity problem
- Robustness: What happens if router malfunctions or is compromised?
	- LS:
		- router can advertise incorrect link cost
		- each router computes only its own table
	- DV
		- DV router can advertise incorrect path cost: black-holing
		- each router's table used by others: error propagate through network
