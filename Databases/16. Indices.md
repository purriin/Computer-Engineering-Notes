## Speeding Up Search
- **Linear search** is too slow for large datasets.
- **Binary search** is faster — requires sorted data.
- If insertions/deletions are needed → use a **binary search tree**.
- Problem: Worst-case performance can be poor.
- Solution: Use a **balanced binary search tree**.
## New Realities in Databases
- **Data won't fit in memory.**
- File pointers are **much slower** than memory pointers.
- OS-level file handling:
  - Reads full **pages** even if only 1 byte is needed.
  - Uses **buffers** to cache pages and avoid repeated reads.
## Design Goals for Databases
- Organize disk pages to make full use of reads.
- Minimize pointer chasing by using **huge branching factors**.
- Result: Use **wide and shallow trees**.
- **B-trees** are ideal.
## What Is a B-Tree?
- [Binary Tree](Binary%20Search%20Trees.md)
- Tree with branching factor M > 2.
- **Balance rules:**
  - All leaves are at the same depth.
  - Every node has at least ⌈M/2⌉ children (except root).
  - Root has at least 2 children unless it’s the only node.
- Height of B-tree with `n` values: ≤ log⌈M/2⌉(n)
## B-Trees in DBMSs
- Each B-tree node is the size of a **disk page**.
- Allows large branching factors (e.g., M = 1024).
- Very few file reads are needed to access any data.
## One More Reality

- B-tree only stores **keys**.
- At the **leaf**, a pointer to the actual data is stored.
- **Separation of index and data**:  
  → B-tree is called an **index** on the data.
## Example

- A B-tree index by `SID` on the `Student` table.
- Want fast access by `surname` too?
  → Create another index.
## SQL: Creating Indexes

```sql
CREATE INDEX off_dept ON offering(dept);
```

**Example Table:**
```
Table "university.offering"
 Column     | Type                 | Modifiers
------------+----------------------+-----------
 oid        | integer              | not null
 cnum       | integer              |
 dept       | department           |
 term       | integer              | not null
 instructor | character varying(40)|

Indexes:
 "offering_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (oid)
 "off_dept" btree (dept)
```
## Should We Index Every Column?
### Advantages:
- Faster search/query performance.
### Disadvantages:
- More space usage.
- Slower inserts, deletes, and updates.
## Database Tuning
- Decide which indices to create based on:
  - Frequency of **search vs update** operations.
  - Type of operations doesn't matter as much (insert vs delete).
- Consider:
  - **Client expectations**
  - **Historical patterns**
- Use **expected workloads** for analysis (like amortized analysis).
## Tuning Advisors

- Area of active research.
- Run experiments with various index configurations.
- Measure performance of queries/updates.
- Recommend best indexing strategy based on performance data.
