### 1. Conditional Execution
- Recall: The processor has an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- Processors need to be able to execute/not some instructions to implement conditional tests
	- e.g. in C code
- The ARM processor uses condition code flags (N,Z,C,V)
	- These flags are in a specific register, CPSR (Current Processor Status Register) and can be set/cleared by instructions that use the ALU

| Flag | Instruction                                            |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| N    | Set to 1 if instruction produces a negative result     |
| Z    | Set to 1 if instruction produces a result of 0         |
| C    | Set to 1 if instruction produces a carry out           |
| V    | Set to 1 if instruction produces a arithmetic overflow |
- **Important**: For an instruction the flags, the instruction must have the suffix 'S'
- **Summary**: You can affect the flags with any data processing instruction (movs, ADDs, SUBs, ANDs, ORRs, ...)
- There is an instruction `CMP` (compare) whos only purpose is to set/clear flags
- You can use flags (conditions) by adding various suffixes in instructions
	- There are many types of conditions supported by ARM
#### 1.1 Conditions

| Suffix | Meaning            | Flag Value   |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------------ |
| EQ     | Equal              | Z = 1        |
| NE     | Not Equal          | Z = 0        |
| CC     | Carry Clear        | C = 0        |
| CS     | Carry Set          | C = 1        |
| PL     | Positive           | N = 0        |
| MI     | Negative           | N = 1        |
| LT     | Less than          | Use multiple |
| LE     | Less than equal    | Use multiple |
| GT     | Greater than       | Use multiple |
| GE     | Greater than equal | Use multiple |
