## 1.1 The Internet: A "Nuts and Bolts" View
- Billions of connected computing **devices**
	- The internet is some cloud - devices connect to it, packets are inside the cloud
	- **Hosts**: end systems
	- Running network **apps** at Internet's "edge"

**Packet Switches**: Forward packets (chunks of data)
- Routers, switches
- Takes a packet (some bits) and routers send them, connected to communication links

- **Communication links**
	- Fiber, copper, radio, satellite
	- **Transmission Rate**: *bandwidth*
- **Networks**
	- Collection of devices, routers, links: managed by an organization
- **Internet**: "network of networks"
	- Connects different networks together.
	- Interconnected ISPs
- **Protocols**
	- Control sending, receiving of messages
	- The language of the internet, piece of software split into 2 between the 2 machines with variable distance
	- Ex. HTTP (Web), streaming video, Skype, TCP, IP, Wi-Fi, 4G, Ethernet
- **Internet Standards**
	- **RFC**: Request for Comments
	- **IETF**: Internet Engineering Task Force
## 1.2 The Internet: A "Service" View
- **Infrastructure** that provides services to applications:
	- Web, streaming video, multimedia teleconferencing, email, games, e-commerce, social media, interconnected appliances, â€¦
- Provides **programming interface** to distributing applications:
	- "hooks" allowing sending/receiving apps to "connect" to, use Internet transport service
	- Provides service options, analogous to postal service

**Protocol**: Defines the *format, order* of *messages sent and received* among network entities and *actions taken* on message transmission, receipt.

- Assume want to see a file, computer and network have to start a conversation which requires a few steps:
	1. TCP connection request
	2. Service responds accepting the connection
	3. Requests via a link
	4. Service send the file

- **Network Edge**:
	- **Hosts**: Clients and servers (data centers)
	- Servers often in data centers
- **Access Networks & Physical Media**:
	- Connection from hosts to the network
	- Wired, wireless communication links
- **Network Core**:
	- Interconnected routers
	- Network of networks

- Access network is for customers, core network is for other networks
## 1.3 Access Networks & Physical Media
- How to connect end systems to edge router?
	- Residential access nets
	- Institutional access networks (school, company)
	- Mobile access networks (Wi-Fi, 4G/5G)
- What to look for:
	- Transmission rate (bits per second) of access network (what kind of service you are getting)
	- Shared or dedicated access among users

- Link coming to home comes directly to your home and only hosts your home is mostly fiber a dedicated wire
- Wired and wireless connections often combined into one box router

- Switch understands its for inside or outside locally or send to router to go out, reduces load for router router doesn't need to examine all packets
	- Switch responsible for inside the network on the data link layer
### 1.3.1 Access Networks: Cable-Based Access
**Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)**: Different channels transmitted in different frequency bands

- **HFC**: Hybrid fiber coax
	- Asymmetric: up to 40 Mbps - 1.2 Gbs downstream transmission rate, 30-100 Mbps upstream transmission rate
- Network of cable, fiber attaches homes to ISP router
	- Homes *share access network* to cable headend
### 1.3.2 Access Networks: Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
- Use *existing* telephone line to central office DSLAM
	- Data over DSL phone line goes to Internet
	- Voice over DSL phone line goes to telephone net
- 24-52 Mbps dedicated downstream transmission rate
- 3.5-16 Mbps dedicated upstream transmission rate
### 1.3.3 Access Networks: Home Networks

### 1.3.4 Access Networks: Enterprise Networks
- Companies, universities, etc.
- Mix of wired, wireless link technologies, connecting a mix of switches and routers
	- **Ethernet**: Wired access at 100Mbps 1Gbps 10Gbps
	- **Wi-Fi**: Wireless access points at 11, 54, 450 Mbps
## 1.4 Wireless Access Networks
- Shared *wireless* access network connects end system to router
	- Via base station aka "access point"

| Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) | Wide-Area Cellular Access Networks |
| ---- | ---- |
| Typically within or around building (~100 ft) | Provided by mobile cellular network operator (10's km) |
| 802.11 b/g/n (Wi-Fi): 11, 54, 450 Mbps transmission rate | 10's Mbps, 4G cellular networks (5G coming) |
## 1.5 Host
**Host**: Sends *packets* of data
- Host sending function
	- Takes application message
	- Breaks into smaller chunks, known as *packets* of length $L$ bits
	- Transmits packet into access network at *transmission rate* $R$
		- Link transmission rate, aka link *capacity, aka link bandwidth*

**Packet**: Is a number of bits concatenated and bundled together know exactly first and last bit want to send it outside

**Propagation Delay**: Time it takes for energy to go from a to , linear relationship

$$
\text{packet transmission delay = time needed to transmit L-bit packet into link } \\
$$
$$
= \frac{L}{R}
$$
$$
\text{total time for last bit to arrive (D) = transmission + propagation delays}
$$
$$
= T_1 + \tau = \frac{L}{R} + \frac{d}{C}
$$
- Where $L$ is number of bits, $R$ is the transmission rate bits/sec, $d$ is the distance, and $C$ is the speed of light $2.5\times10^8m/sec$ 
## 1.6 Links
**Link**: Physical media

- **Bit**: Propagates between transmitter/receiver pairs
- **Physical Link**: What lies between transmitter & receiver (wired or wireless)
- **Guided Media**: Signals propagate in solid media: copper, fiber, coax (follows curve of the wire)
- **Unguided Media**: Signals propagate freely. Ex. Radio (cannot control where the information foes)

**Twisted Pair (TP)**: Two insulated copper wires
- Category 5: 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps Ethernet
- Category 6: 10 Gbps Ethernet
- Guided

**Coaxial Cable**: Two concentric copper conductors
- Bidirectional
- Broadband: Multiple frequency channels on cable, 100's Mbps per channel
- Guided

**Fiber Optic Cable**: Glass fiber carrying light pulses each pulse a bit
- High-Speed Operation: High-speed point-to-point transmission (10's-100's Gbps)
- Low Error Rate: Repeaters spaced far apart, immune to electromagnetic noise
- Guided

**Wireless Radio**: Signal carries in electromagnetic spectrum
- No physical "wire"
- Broadcast and "half-duplex" (sender to receiver)
- Propagation environment effects:
	- Reflection
	- Obstruction by objects
	- Interference
- Unguided

**Radio Link Types**:
- Terrestrial Microwave: up to 45 Mbps channels
- Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi): up to 100's Mbps
- Wire-area (Ex. cellular): 4G cellular: ~10's Mbps
- Satellite: up to 45 Mbps per channel, 270 msec end-end delay, geosynchronous versus low-earth-orbit
