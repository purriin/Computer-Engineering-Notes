## 10.1 Database Modifications
- Queries can return a relation
- A modification command does not; it changes the database in some way
- 3 kinds of modifications:
	1. Insert a tuple or tuples
	2. Delete a tuple or tuples
	3. Update the value(s) of an existing tuple or tuples

## 10.2 Insert
- We've already seen 2 ways to insert rows into an empty table:
	1. `INSERT INTO <table> VALUES <list of rows>;`
	2. `INSERT INTO <table> (<subquery>);`
- These can also be used to add rows to a non-empty table

**Naming Attributes in INSERT**
- Sometimes we want to insert tuples but we don't have values for all attributes
- If we name the attributes we *are* providing values for, the system will use `NULL` or a default for the rest
- Ex.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Invite (
	name TEXT,
	campus TEXT DEFAULT ‘StG’,
	email TEXT,
	age INT);
INSERT INTO Invite(name, email)
	( SELECT firstname, email
	FROM Student
	WHERE cgpa > 3.4 );
```
- Here, name and email get values from the query, campus gets the default value, and age gets NULL.

## 10.3 Deletion
- Delete tuples satisfying a condition:
```sql
DELETE FROM <relation>
WHERE <condition>;
```

- Delete all tuples: `DELETE FROM <relation>;`
- Ex.
```sql
DELETE FROM Course  
WHERE NOT EXISTS (  
	SELECT *  
	FROM Took JOIN Offering  
		ON Took.oid = Offering.oid  
	WHERE  
		grade > 50 AND  
		Offering.dept = Course.dept AND  
		Offering.cnum = Course.cnum  
);  
```

## 10.4 Updates
- To change the value of certain attributes in certain tuples to given values:
```sql
UPDATE «relation»  
SET «list of attribute assignments»  
WHERE «condition on tuples»;
```
- Ex.
```sql
-- Updating one tuple:
UPDATE Student  
SET campus = ‘UTM’  
WHERE sid = 99999;

-- Updating several tuples:
UPDATE Took  
SET grade = 50  
WHERE grade >= 47 and grade < 50;
```

- Cannot `DROP` a schema if other things depend on it, use `CASCADE` to drop also what depends on it 
	- Can include `IF EXISTS` to see if the data still exists
	- Gives a fresh set of data to work with
